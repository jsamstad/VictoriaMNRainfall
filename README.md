**Purpose: Being a homeowner is great in many different areas, but having to take care of your grass is not one of them.**

While my grass is not the worst of the block, I've decided to step it up to amateur status. Grass needs 1-2 inches of water per week, and I've just been guessing in the previous two years. Now, I've finally procured some gauges and found out I've been underwatering by a fair amount!

I need to know how much free stuff nature is providing per week and what I need to contribute via a high water bill.
